Message_0_Page_0 If you're a fan of Jp mods, you may know of a mod called Street Tuning Unturned, well that was a testing mod for a very cool tuning feature, well guess what? That's making a comeback now! It's not as detailed as STU of course, but you'll still be able to enjoy a part of it.
Message_0_Page_1 I've put up a few amount of options of bumpers and spoilers for you to check out, I'll give you the materials so you know how to craft them! The rest is up to you.
Message_0_Page_2 Be aware that not all the cars fit every part, mainly all the cars can fit a custom bumper, but not every car fits a custom spoiler!
Message_0_Page_3 Oh and by the way, Jp has created, Paint cans! Now you can paint your spoilers to whatever color you want, either when you craft them, or afterwards, I'll give you a few colors so you can test it out.
Message_0_Page_4 If you selected the Mern SL63, well that doesn't have a spoiler option, but you can ask me for a car that has it, and I'll give you one.
Response_0 Let's go!
Response_1 Give me more materials!
Response_2 Give me all the color cans!
Response_3 I picked the Mern, give me a new car, please.
