Message_0_Page_0 Scrap Metal! Similar to Cloth, can be stacked in either 10 or 25 of them, to stack the huge amount of 25 you'll need a crate though!
Message_0_Page_1 Check your Barricades tab in the Crafting Menu, you'll see everything you need there.
Message_0_Page_2 If you're done already, go to Peter's factory, he'll show you a small feature that's being added. By the way! Pretty much everything you've seen so far can be either crafter or found in a vanilla map, so you don't miss out on the content if you're playing a regular survival!
Response_0 Thanks! I'll check the other Logistics.
Response_1 Thanks! I'll go to Peter's.
