Message_0_Page_0 Logs! For now you can only stack logs in a stack of 12, and in all 3 of different kinds, later you'll be able to stack planks, sticks and more! I'll give you just one kind of wood, for space, but if you want to try the rest just crash into a tree and craft it!
Message_0_Page_1 Check your Barricades tab in the Crafting Menu, you'll see everything you need there.
Message_0_Page_2 If you're done already, go to Peter's factory, he'll show you a small feature that's being added. By the way! Pretty much everything you've seen so far can be either crafter or found in a vanilla map, so you don't miss out on the content if you're playing a regular survival!
Response_0 Thanks! I'll check the other Logistics.
Response_1 Thanks! I'll go to Peter's.
