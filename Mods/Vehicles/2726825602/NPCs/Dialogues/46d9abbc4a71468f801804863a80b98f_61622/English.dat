Message_0_Page_0 Unlike Vanilla Vehicles 2, VV3 is not only a vehicles mod, so you will have a plethora of new tools to enjoy your gameplay even more.
Message_0_Page_1 We'll start by giving you another set of keys that you might have got already from Jp at the start of your journey, these work as a cooler looking stealy wheelie, basically.
Message_0_Page_2 Next, you'll get a brand new, cool DeNardo Impact Driver, long gone are the times of that boring manual socket wrench.
Message_0_Page_3 Finally you'll get a brand new battery, it works the same as the vanilla one, but honestly looks cooler, doesn't it? Also! There are more than one variety of some tools, you'll find them around when gathering for resources.
Message_0_Page_4 Remember! This mod is still in development and YOU can make it even better, join VV3's discord to suggest new vehicles, items and features! JP doesn't play Unturned so he doesn't really know what players like you really want, so help him!
Response_0 Cool! Give me the items.
