Message_0_Page_0 Hey! <color=#FFCD00><name_npc></color> here. Lastly, Makeshift cars have been around in Unturned for a few years, but they have always been so simple! So here's my solution. A new Makeshift vehicle!
Message_0_Page_1 You start with a chassis, and then build a body for it, pretty straight forwards isn't it. There are 3 different bodies, a wooden one, with low health, a metal one with decent health, and a full on production on, with a ton of health and pretty good looks (basic though, you built it yourself after all) Of course you'll need skills to do this, so be prepared!
Message_0_Page_2 Even though I find this cool, I don't think it'll be used very much so don't expect to much content beyond this (unless I'm proven wrong)
Message_0_Page_3 I'll give you the stuff that you need to build everything from scratch, so here we go, first we need the chassis.
Response_0 Let's build the chassis.
Response_1 I've already built the chassis.
