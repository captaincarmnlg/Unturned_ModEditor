Message_0_Page_0 Hey welcome to the VV3 Tutorial Map! <pause> I'm <color=#FFCD00><name_npc></color>, the creator of Vanilla Vehicles 3 and here you're basically going to do a quick walk around some of the features that the mod has to offer. (Don't expect the map to be from very good quality btw, as long as it works, cool xD)
Message_0_Page_1 Remember though! VV3 is still in development so not everything you see around is final, with your help we can make this even better!
Message_0_Page_2 Let's start with your journey then, are you ready?
Response_0 I'm ready!
Response_1 Nah, I'm good. Lame mod anyways.
